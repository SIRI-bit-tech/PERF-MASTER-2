- Real-time monitoring via WebSockets

### 2. **AI Analysis Engine**
The AI analyzes your application by:
- Examining component code for performance bottlenecks
- Identifying optimization opportunities
- Providing impact estimates for each suggestion
- Generating optimized code snippets

### 3. **Real-time Dashboard**
View your application's performance through:
- Interactive charts and graphs
- Real-time metrics updates
- Performance alerts and notifications
- Historical trend analysis

## üë®‚Äçüíª How Developers Use PerfMaster

### Getting Started

1. **Create an Account**
   - Sign up at https://perfmaster.dev
   - Verify your email and set up your profile

2. **Create Your First Project**
   - Click "New Project" in the dashboard
   - Enter your project details (name, description, technology stack)
   - Get your unique Project ID and API key

3. **Integrate the SDK**

   For React/Next.js applications:
   ```bash
   npm install @perfmaster/sdk
   ```

   ```javascript
   // In your main app file
   import { PerfMaster } from '@perfmaster/sdk'

   PerfMaster.init({
     projectId: 'your-project-id',
     apiKey: 'your-api-key'
   })
   ```

   For vanilla JavaScript:
   ```html
   <script src="https://cdn.perfmaster.dev/sdk.js"></script>
   <script>
     PerfMaster.init({
       projectId: 'your-project-id',
       apiKey: 'your-api-key'
     })
   </script>
   ```

### Using the Dashboard

#### **Real-time Monitoring**
- View live performance metrics in the dashboard
- Monitor Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS, FCP, TTFB)
- Track memory usage and CPU utilization
- Set up custom alerts for performance thresholds

#### **AI Analysis**
- Upload your component code for analysis
- Get automated performance suggestions
- View impact estimates for each optimization
- Apply suggestions with one-click code generation

#### **Team Collaboration**
- Invite team members to your projects
- Set performance goals and track progress

- Collaborate on performance improvement initiatives

### API Integration

PerfMaster provides a REST API for advanced integrations:

```javascript
// Analyze performance metrics
const analysis = await fetch('/api/v1/performance/analyze/', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    lcp: 2.1,
    fid: 5.2,
    cls: 0.1,
    // ... other metrics
  })
})

// Get optimization suggestions
const suggestions = await fetch('/api/v1/suggestions/?project_id=your-project-id')
  .then(res => res.json())
```

### WebSocket Integration

For real-time features:

```javascript
// Connect to performance monitoring
const ws = new WebSocket('wss://api.perfmaster.dev/ws/performance/your-project-id')

ws.onmessage = (event) => {
  const data = JSON.parse(event.data)
  // Handle real-time performance updates
}

// Connect to team collaboration
const teamWs = new WebSocket('wss://api.perfmaster.dev/ws/team/your-project-id')
```
